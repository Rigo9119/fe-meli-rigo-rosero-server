## Improvements and issues

As I dont really have a big experience with node js and doing api's you will 
find some mistakes on this repo, one of them being that one of the objects to be used
on one of the endpoints could be reuse but I couldnt figure how to extract the object form 
the endpoint.

Also for some reason that at the moment of the development i didnt figure the endpoint of 
the search will always provide the same search results doesnt matter if the client types 
something different on the searchbox. 

I have to mention that im not happy at all with the result and development of this api 
but it give me the chance to learn something new and at the end of the day it provides some 
data to work on the client side of the app/test.
